    "text": "Welcome! Yoga is for everyone, no matter what your physical conditions are. You dont need to be flexible or strong. But with a steady practice, you can become more flexible and stronger, as well as acheive a wide variety of other health benefits (cardiovascular, hormonal balance, stability, and good posture), as well as emotional balance. Yoga will make you stronger inside and out.\nFor beginners there is a pose for everyone. and all poses can be modified. For more advanced students (and we are all students) you will benefit as you perfect the poses you have been practicing,\nYoga is much more than just the poses, as poses are only 1 in 8 aspects of yoga that support spiritual growth."

    "text": "Shoulder stands were never my favorite. I always felt like i was just flailing my legs ups and crunching into my neck. It was also boring to me. But I decided to learn them all over again,\nShoulder stands offer a wide variety of health benefits, by directing pranba and blood flow up your body, .It also helps balance out hormones, particularly improve thyroid function, And if held long enough i found that it strengthens key muscle groups particularly the core and legs. After practicing shoulder stands for 5 minutes every morning, I was able to maintain better posture throughout the day. As with all poses, its best to practice with focus on the breath and channel the direction of prana to the relevant body parts. In shoulder stands, its keeping they eyes closed, breathing slowly and completely, with exhales longer than inhales, and imagining the prana moving upwards."

Welcome! Yoga is for everyone, no matter what your physical conditions are. You dont need to be flexible or strong. But with a steady practice, you can become more flexible and stronger, as well as acheive a wide variety of other health benefits (cardiovascular, hormonal balance, stability, and good posture), as well as emotional balance. Yoga will make you stronger inside and out.

For beginners there is a pose for everyone. and all poses can be modified. For more advanced students (and we are all students) you will benefit as you perfect the poses you have been practicing,

Yoga is much more than just the poses, as poses are only 1 in 8 aspects of yoga that support spiritual growth.
